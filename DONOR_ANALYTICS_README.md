## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. **Run migrations** (if any new migrations were added):
```bash
cd capstone_backend
php artisan migrate
```

2. **Seed sample data**:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=AnalyticsSampleSeeder
```

This creates:
- 20 sample donors (donor1@test.com to donor20@test.com)
- 5 sample charities (charity1@test.com to charity5@test.com)
- 40 campaigns across various types and locations
- Hundreds of donations with varied dates
- Password for all: `password`

3. **Run tests**:
```bash
php artisan test --filter=DonorAnalyticsTest
```

4. **Clear cache** (optional, for fresh data):
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed):
```bash
cd capstone_frontend
npm install
```

2. **Start development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Access the analytics page**:
   - Login as a donor
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/donor/campaign-analytics`

## Usage Guide

### Accessing Analytics
1. Log in as a donor
2. From the donor dashboard, navigate to "Campaign Analytics" (or directly via `/donor/campaign-analytics`)

### Using Filters
- **Date Range**: Select preset ranges (7/30/90/365 days) or custom dates
- **Campaign Types**: Multi-select checkbox for filtering by campaign type
- **Granularity**: Choose daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation
- Click "Apply Filters" to refresh data
- Click "X" button to reset all filters

### Exploring Tabs

#### Overview Tab
- Campaign type distribution (pie chart)
- Top trending campaigns (bar chart)
- Top charities by donations (ranked list)

#### Distribution Tab
- Geographic distribution by region/province/city
- Beneficiary breakdown (who benefits from campaigns)

#### Trends Tab
- Donation growth over time (line chart)
- Campaign frequency (bar chart showing new campaigns)

#### Insights Tab
- Auto-generated natural language insights
- "Why This Matters" section explaining significance

### Drill-Down
Click on any campaign in the trending list to see detailed analytics for that specific campaign (feature implemented in backend, UI drill-down can be added).

## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching**: All queries cached with 3-5 minute TTL
- **Efficient Queries**: Uses SQL aggregations and indexes
- **Pagination**: Top lists limited to 10-20 items
- **Lazy Loading**: Charts load independently

### Security & Privacy
- Site-wide analytics show **aggregated public data only**
- Personal donor details are **not exposed**
- Donor-specific analytics (`/donor/{id}/overview`) require authentication and ownership verification
- All endpoints require `auth:sanctum` middleware

### Data Aggregation Logic

**Campaign Type Distribution**:
```sql
SELECT campaign_type, COUNT(*) as count, SUM(current_amount) as total_raised
FROM campaigns
WHERE status != 'archived'
GROUP BY campaign_type
```

**Trending Campaigns**:
```sql
SELECT campaigns.*, COUNT(donations.id) as donation_count
FROM campaigns
LEFT JOIN donations ON campaigns.id = donations.campaign_id
WHERE donations.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY campaigns.id
ORDER BY donation_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Location Distribution**:
```sql
SELECT region, COUNT(*) as campaign_count, SUM(current_amount) as total_raised
FROM campaigns
GROUP BY region
```

## Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/DonorAnalyticsTest.php
```

Test coverage:
- ✅ Summary endpoint
- ✅ Query endpoint with filters
- ✅ Campaign details endpoint
- ✅ Donor overview endpoint
- ✅ Authorization checks
- ✅ Date range filtering
- ✅ Caching behavior

### Frontend Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Adviser Requirements Mapping

| Requirement | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| What type of campaigns is always conducted | Campaign type distribution chart + percentage breakdown |
| How many times campaign was conducted in week/monthly | Campaign frequency time series with granularity control |
| Which charity always conducts that type | Charity rankings filtered by type |
| Typical range of fund for campaign | Donation stats: min, max, avg, median (in campaign details) |
| Who's the beneficiaries | Beneficiary breakdown chart + table |
| Frequent location of campaign | Location distribution by region/province/city with counts |
| Detailed explanation of trending campaign | Campaign details endpoint with "why_trending" analysis |
| Analysis of donor donations | Personal donor overview endpoint (`/donor/{id}/overview`) |

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- **No map visualization**: Location data is shown in tables/charts but not on an interactive map (can add Leaflet integration)
- **No lat/lng coordinates**: Campaigns don't store coordinates for heatmap visualization
- **Basic insights**: Natural language insights are template-based (could integrate AI/ML for smarter analysis)

### Suggested Enhancements
1. **Interactive Maps**: Add Leaflet/MapBox for geographic visualization
2. **Export to PDF/CSV**: Allow users to download analytics reports
3. **Comparison Mode**: Compare two time periods side-by-side
4. **Email Reports**: Schedule and email periodic analytics summaries
5. **Predictive Analytics**: ML models for donation forecasting
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for live donation tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to fetch analytics"
- **Check**: Backend server is running (`php artisan serve`)
- **Check**: User is authenticated (logged in)
- **Check**: API URL is correct in `.env` (VITE_API_URL)

### Issue: No data showing
- **Solution**: Run the seeder: `php artisan db:seed --class=AnalyticsSampleSeeder`
- **Check**: Database has campaigns and donations

### Issue: Slow performance
- **Solution**: Ensure Redis is running for cache
- **Check**: Database indexes are created
- **Fallback**: Increase cache TTL in controller

### Issue: Charts not rendering
- **Check**: Recharts is installed (`npm install recharts`)
- **Check**: Browser console for JavaScript errors
