## 🔌 Backend Integration

### API Endpoints Used ✅
All endpoints already exist in the backend:

1. **GET `/api/campaigns/filter-options`**
   - Fetches available filter options (types, regions, provinces, cities)
   - Used to populate dropdowns dynamically

2. **GET `/api/campaigns/filter`**
   - Main endpoint for campaign listing with filters
   - Query parameters:
     - `search` - Search term
     - `campaign_type` - Filter by type
     - `region`, `province`, `city` - Location filters
     - `min_goal`, `max_goal` - Goal amount range
     - `start_date`, `end_date` - Date range
     - `status` - Default: 'published'
     - `page`, `per_page` - Pagination (12 per page)
   - Returns paginated results with campaign data

### Data Mapping ✅
- ✅ Backend campaign data → `CampaignCard` component props
- ✅ Status mapping: `published` → `active`, `closed` → `completed`, `archived` → `expired`
- ✅ Progress calculation from current_amount/target_amount
- ✅ Image URLs properly constructed
